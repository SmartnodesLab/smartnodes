# TaskNet/Brainstorm/Synergy/Synaptic:

## Use Cases:
- similar structure to an oracle network, but instead of computers aggregating API calls, human are responding to calls from automated and/or decentralized systems.
- could work for any automated task that requires human input (poll a group of people to decide what to do)
- the moderation of online and real-world ecosystems (social media, online markets)
  -  the decentralized 'customer service' of the internet
-  could serve as a marketplace for jobs as well

- there will also be the option (potentially thru seperate network/smart contract) for co-operative/competitive AI training, as well as markets for models and datasets
  -  distributed machine learning for large-scale datasets/models
  -  on-demand API calls to these distributed AI models for execution (e.g. for an LLM-based helper-bot online)
  -  cloud network architecture for machine learning execution in a distributed manner, negating the need for a centralized entity

## Polling System
- poll is broadcasted to the network (i.e. question, voting, censuses...), then a random or filtered selection of users are pinged to respond to the call
- polls have a locked reward, which can be distributed among the majority voters, randomly, or amongst everyone
- can be closed manually or after a certain number of votes is reached
- cost can be fixed/proportional to number or quality of voters 
- poll description can include recommended format/responses (e.g. multiple choice), this can help the automated system determine when to close the poll and the quality of the answers

## Computing System
- datasets can be uploaded/interacted with through the blockchain, allowing for various distributed forms of model training and execution
- users can compete to solve datasets or train collaboratively, depending on job type
- models can be instantiated and distributed to be executed on a large-scale for dApps and other applications

## Users
- username. AddressId, descriptors/filter words (i.e. sex, DoB, nationality, religion, occupation, interests)
- hold reputation of previous polls (% accuracy / majority votes for instance)

## Preventing Abuse
- pay to mint a user token (user smart contract)
- lock payment for work
- repuation / score for jobs
- users can dispute through a reporting system (disputed poll is fed back to the network to be voted upon again)
