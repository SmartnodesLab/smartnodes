# TaskNet (Polls):

## Use Cases
- similar structure to an oracle network, but composed of a user-based polling system as opposed to aggregated API calls by computers
- the moderation of online and real-world ecosystems (social media, online markets)
  -  the decentralized 'customer service' of the internet
-  any automated task that requires human input can poll a group of people to decide what to do
-  could serve as a marketplace for jobs as well

## Polling System
- poll is broadcasted to the network (a question, opinion, polls, voting...), then a random or filtered selection of users are pinged to respond to the call
- polls have a locked reward, which can be distributed among the majority voters, randomly, or amongst everyone
- can be closed manually or after a certain number of votes is reached
- cost can be fixed/proportional to number or quality of voters 
- poll description can include recommended format/responses (e.g. multiple choice), this can help the automated system determine when to close the poll and the quality of the answers

## Users
- username. AddressId, descriptors/filter words (i.e. sex, DoB, nationality, religion, occupation, interests)
- hold reputation of previous polls (% accuracy / majority votes for instance)

## Preventing Abuse
- pay to mint a user token (user smart contract)
- lock payment for work
- repuation / score for jobs
- users can dispute through a reporting system (disputed poll is fed back to the network to be voted upon again)
